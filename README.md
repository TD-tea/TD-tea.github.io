This porfolio project was for my DIMA 358 web design class. We were tasked to create a portfolio with certain html and css elements to learn more about the languages.
Some notable features that we had to include were picures, videos, and imbedded PDF files.
All of this while creating a professional website that we can use to show our skills.
You can see the website at: https://td-tea.github.io/ 

The other project is also linked in the portfolio website. Under the game tab you can see my creative coding project. Game usees p5js and ml5js to create an interactive experience
that will leave a lasting impression on users that visit my website.
Game explores my itch of finding alternative methods of interacting with a computer and games in general as I find that not very many people have explored this idea so it was an experiemnt to see
how well the technology works. So instead of moving around with a mouse and keyboard, the player is using their hand(or hands) to dodge certain object thrown their way. 
To run the game just navigate to the game page and click the game header, it will take to to the game and you can play it.
