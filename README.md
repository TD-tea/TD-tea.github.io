This porfolio project was for my DIMA 358 web design class. We were tasked to create a portfolio with certain html and css elements to learn more about the languages.
Some notable features that we had to include were picures, videos, and imbedded PDF files.
All of this while creating a professional website that we can use to show our skills.
You can see the website at: https://td-tea.github.io/ 

The other project is also linked in the portfolio website. Under the game tab you can see my creative coding project. Game usees p5js and ml5js to create an interactive experience
that will leave a lasting impression on users that visit my website.
Game explores my itch of finding alternative methods of interacting with a computer and games in general as I find that not very many people have explored this idea so it was an experiemnt to see
how well the technology works. So instead of moving around with a mouse and keyboard, the player is using their hand(or hands) to dodge certain object thrown their way.
There is also a full body tracking version also on the same game page that is similar but uses full body tracking instead of just hand tracking. This is more of a challenge but also more fun
as it require the player to run around more.
To run the game just navigate to the game page and click the game header, it will take to to the game and you can play it.
The overall concept of the game was a little inspired by like Wii fit and other exersize games like beat saber, games that make you move around. The access to these types of games are often locked
behind hadware requirements either a game console or VR headset and this was a way I though it could be done better. Using ML5 and the body and handtracking models, I belive I have delivered on a similar
experience but with less hardware requirements. (this is the domain part I think)

This project was for Human and Computer Interaction(HCI) class, where we learned about humans and computers and how they interact. 
It is the cumulation of all the things we learned throughout the semester, all the principles, design choices, accessibility prinicples all incorperated into one project.
The app is a task manamgement app that helps families organize tasks and chores in one place. It allows users to add family members, create and assign tasks to every member, and it has a leaderboard
functionality to keep track of who has done the most tasks for the family and who has the most points.
